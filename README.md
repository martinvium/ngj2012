# Soul Craver

A 2D "hot-controller" game for 2 players. Each player is in control of one stick of a single XBOX 360 controller. By moving the sticks, the players move their avatars, either the inner devil or the inner angel.

By moving the avatars, the child is being dragged along. Both players can neutralize each others forces or somehow try to get superior to the other player. Doing so they need to drag the child over several items which make the child commit either evil or rather good deeds.

As soon as the Sane-O-Meter reaches the end of one side, this side prevails.

If the players neutralize each others movements for too long, the grim reaper will appear trying to collect the childs soul for himself.
